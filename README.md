# Ebook template

This project serves as a Github template to generate ebooks.

This is the minimal structure needed for the ebook to be valid according to the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-packages.html) documentation.

The ebook has been validated with the [epubcheck] tool (https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck).

This project is not intended to remain in its minimal version.

More details in the future.
